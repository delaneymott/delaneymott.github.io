<h1><b>Field Hockey</b></h1>

<p>This is my team and I during my senior year when we came to support one of the University of Maine's players, Dani Aviani. She's since graduated and moved on to coach at a college down South. She always came and supported our team during our games and it always empowered us to have her there to look up to. We were very grateful as a team to have her there.</p>

<h1><b>Traveling</b></h1>

<p>Ever since I can remember, I loved traveling and exploring and embracing new cultures. This photo was from my 4th stay on a small island in the Bahamas called Green Turtle Cay. Over the course of my life I've stayed/lived there 5 times. My family always rented the same house every time we stayed there and those are where my very best childhood memories are. I spent my 10th birthday there and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to top that one. I hope to continue my travels into my career and continuously explore more cultures.</p>

<h1><b>Hiking</b></h1>

<p>Before I moved into college, my mom and I wanted to hike another monumental peak in New England. We have already hiked Mt. Katahdin many times and didn't really want to do that again, so we decided on Mount Washington. It was an incredible day and there wasn't a cloud in the sky until we came back down. The view was insanely beautiful and I would hike that again in a heartbeat. I love hiking because I always love the sense of accomplishment you get once you reach the top and see where you hiked and the view that was always worth it!</p>

<h1><b>Flying</b></h1>

<p>My stepdad Jeffrey, has his pilot's license and loves taking me up to learn how to fly. I've always loved planes because boarding one meant you were going somewhere to experience something new. I'm slowing learning to fly, with one main goal of obtaining my private pilot license.</p>
