<h1><b>Brit</b></h1>


<h2><b>My 4 year old Yellow Lab/Shar Pei puppy!</b></h2>

<p>We first adopted Brit when she was only 1 and had just given birth to a
litter of 8 puppies! She is originally from South Carolina, so when she first
saw snow it was a really funny experience! She's just a little dog but she's got
enough energy to last a lifetime! My mom had been looking for a dog for quite
awhile, and her childhood friend fostered them all the time. One day she called
my mom and told her she had the perfect dog for her. My mom went and met Brit
and we took her home a week later!</p>
