<p><i>Welcome to my website!</i></p> <p>I'm seventeen years old and I've lived in Maine my whole life. In the future I hope to travel for my job, I love seeing new cultures and experiencing new things. I have a dog named Brit with my mom and step dad. They live in Otis on Beech Hill Pond. My mom is a licensed appraiser and my step dad owns storage units and is a pilot. My dad lives in Brewer and is a Sales Representative for Amerisource Bergan, which means he travels a lot. My best friend's name is Maggie Coyle and we do everything together. We've gone on vacations together, gotten lost on road trips, and made stupid memories and I know she'll always be my best friend (that's her and I below). I hope you enjoy my site!!</p>
